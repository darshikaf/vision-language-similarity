# Vision-Language Similarity Service Load Test URLs
# Health and metrics endpoints
/evaluator/health
/evaluator/v1/evaluation/health
/evaluator/metrics

# API endpoints (GET requests)
/evaluator/v1/evaluation/models

# Root endpoint
/evaluator/
/

# Note: POST endpoints require JSON payloads and are harder to test with simple curl
# They would need more sophisticated load testing tools like:
# /evaluator/v1/evaluation/single (requires image_input and text_prompt)
# /evaluator/v1/evaluation/batch (requires array of evaluations)
